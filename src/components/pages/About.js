                <p> 
                My name is Donovan. I'm a neophile with an eye for novelty in the ordinary. My goal in life is to have a cooler Wikipedia page than Da Vinci before I die.
                <br/><br/>
                I've wanted to design video games since I was a little kid, so I learned to program. Pretty soon I'll link to some games I'm working on here. I also think blockchain is really cool, and I want to work with AI, too.
                <br/><br/>
                I want to be a rock star and go Hollywood. I want to rubbertramp around the US in a van and sail around the mediterranean.
                <br/><br/>
                I want to make enough money to outpace the theft of wealth by the ruling class and leave my kids more than I started with. And I want to be able to afford kids before I have them.
                <br/><br/>
                My favorite color is purple but it didn't look good so I made this website with a sort of fuschia color instead.
                <br/><br/>
                Every time I make a &lt;br/&gt; I think of the money printer.

                <p>
                I find that I learn best by taking notes. I also find that I frequently revisit my notes when programming because I work like a machine but don't have the memory of one.
                <br/><br/>
                I want to build a respectable portfolio to demonstrate that I am a capable front-end developer, and I want to work on more projects that have the potential to earn me passive income.
                <br/><br/>
                In other words, creating this website was simply the path of least resistance. I made a resource for myself that hopefully can benefit other people as well. I hope you find whatever you're looking for! If not, don't hesitate to reach out.
