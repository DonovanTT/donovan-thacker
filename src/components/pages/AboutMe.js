                <p>
                My name is Donovan.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm a Software Engineer from Vermont. I studied Computer Information Systems at Castleton University and graduated in December 2020. When I'm not programming I enjoy snowboarding, cooking, and playing chess. I love travelling and I haven't done nearly enough.
                <br/><br/>
                I got started coding around the age of nine or so, after discovering Gamer Maker 5. Much of my childhood was spent either playing video games or imagining up games that I wanted to play, from using paper and pencil before discovering Game Maker 5, to using Yoyo Games's GML in Game Maker Studio, and eventually using HTML5 and the MERN stack, which this website is built on.

                I'm frustrated to admit that none of them have ever been published, or even completed, really. I'm prone to scope creep and I'm apt to think I have a better idea before I've finished my last. Still, it's been good practice, and invaluable experience in learning the problem solving skills required by the job.
                <br/><br/>
                Along the way I also used C++, Visual Basic, Java, JSON, and SQL. I'd like to learn PHP and Python, and I'm particularly eager to work with AI and blockchain technologies. I believe these, along with quantum computers and green energy, will be among the most defining technologies of the 21st Century.
                <br/><br/>
                I'd like to go back to school for some sort of Engineering (possibly Computer or Electrical but maybe Mechanical or Chemical - if I could do them all, I would), Economics, and/or Law. I'm not necessarily concerned with degrees, though I do recognize their benefit to my marketability. I really just want to learn.
                <br/><br/>
                I'd also like to learn another language. I've learned a little bit of Spanish and Italian but I wouldn't consider myself fluent in either - I'd like to get there. I'm working on learning to play the guitar and the piano, too. See, like I said. Scope creep.
                <br/><br/>
                I've also got an orange kitten named Chicken Nugget Î£:3
